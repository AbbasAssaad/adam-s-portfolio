            <h3>Project 1: Clothing Brand that Supports Blind People</h3>
            <p>I’m currently creating a clothing brand designed by my mother who is a graphic designer and a painter, for each t-shirt that we will design<br> <br> I will add a quote that will be written in normal letter and also in braille so blind people can read the text.<br><br> For each product sold, 20% of the benefits will be reversed to a blind association that I am still looking for.<br><br> Here are some examples of the brand t-shirts.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Barbarc Paris for Olympic Games</h3>
            <p>I'm also currently working on a project for the Olympic Games in Paris. I'm in the process of opening a temporary boutique for a well-known ice cream brand,<br><br> Barbarac Saint Tropez in Paris. Their ice cream is known for its authentic flavor,<br><br> which attracts well-known customers to Saint Tropez every summer. The specialty of the shop I'll be opening this summer during the Olympic Games will be that I'll<br><br> be selling only ice cream sticks - a first for Barbarac, who will be supplying them to me directly from their factory.<br><br> This exclusivity will enable me to stand out from the competition with ice creams that are easier to eat and transport and will also be quicker to sell as there will be no preparation of ice cream cones or pots.<br><br> I still have some issues with the rental of the shop preventing me from making the opening official.</p>
